Siddiq, who is from Houston, has been on the comedy circuit for more than 15 years, engaging audiences of various racial, economic, and cultural backgrounds as a headliner in stand-up comedy and in a variety of other media as a writer, producer, and host.<p>Siddiq began honing his craft at Just Joking in Houston, where he relentlessly pursued the mike before becoming a weekly featured comic. He developed his brand on Just Joking, honed his comedic storytelling abilities, and attracted the attention of some of the best comics in the business. Siddiq's pursuit of this interest paid off as he later went on to tour or collaborate with a number of notable performers, including D.L. Hughley, Bill Bellamy, Bill Burr, Cedric the Entertainer, Angela Johnson, Bobby Lee, Katt Williams, Eddie Griffin, Maz Jobrani, J. Anthony Brown, Bruce Bruce, Mike Epps, Rickey Smiley, and Kevin Hart.</p><p>Siddiq performed on four seasons of BET's Comic View, finished in the top three of NBC Universal's Stand Up for Diversity, made an appearance in the season finale of HBO's Def Comedy Jam, and performed on BET's One Mic Stand and Bill Bellamy's Who's Got Jokes, which aired on TV One. Siddiq has contributed his voice and opinion to TV One's Washington Watch, hosted by Roland Martin, in addition to his stand-up performances. This appearance demonstrated his dedication to making sure his audience not only laughed, but also learned something.</p><p>Siddiq, who is well known for his ability to engage audiences, also uses this talent to engage with his community. The Jive Turkey Comedy Jam, which is produced by Siddiq, recently gathered canned items for the North Texas Food Bank. He also served as the keynote speaker at the 2012 Freshman Orientation at Texas Southern University. Additionally, Siddiq gave a set titled "Vote for your Dayum Self" at a Texas League of Young Voters Education Fund event that encouraged attendees to vote in the 2012 election..</p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire Ali Siddiq for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire Ali Siddiq or research availability and pricing for booking Ali Siddiq to perform at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire Ali Siddiq as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking Ali Siddiq to perform.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Ali Siddiq in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming. They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Ali Siddiq or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>Ali Siddiq's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Ali Siddiq for your party.

"How much does it cost to book Ali Siddiq for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Ali Siddiq booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Ali Siddiq charge for an event. An example fee to book Ali Siddiq is in the starting range of $25,000-$39,999. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Ali Siddiq for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Ali Siddiq agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Ali Siddiq, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Ali Siddiq booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Ali Siddiq, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Performer</p><p><b>Style</b><br>Comedian</p><p><b>Range</b><br>Comedian, Male, Age Group-18-30's, African American</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COam1sa2dkrq21jKygnZyZpnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-does-an-empty-mason-jar-weigh-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How much does an empty mason jar weigh?">&larr;
