The outing was extremely successful and the show received high ratings on numerous sites, including IMDB.</p><p>She got her first acting break in The Kate Logan Affair, a Canadian drama film written and directed by Nol Mitrani, starring Alexis Bledel and Laurent Lucas. The story was about a young psychologically unstable policewoman named Kate Logan and a married Frenchman who become involved in a dramatic twisted affair.
