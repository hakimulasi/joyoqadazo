She explained how it had left her ‘worrying for her sanity and wracked with anxiety, as she struggles to do things she used to do with ease. Fiona shared: ‘I’ve cried a thousand rivers in the past few weeks and I’ve got nothing to be sad about. ‘I’ve been fearing for my sanity and am scared to do things I’ve been doing with ease for years. They call it brain fog, I don’t know what I’m talking about half the time.’</p><p>Fiona said that she now fears for her ‘whole life’ and recently ran out of a supermarket after feeling overwhelmed. She explains: ‘God, it’s horrible, I haven’t worked for the first time in my life, I can’t do television work because I’m so anxious and just scared of everything and I’m not that kind of person at all. I have the intent to do everything I used to do, but then your body, your brain, doesn’t let you. ‘The fear takes over. I hope to God this isn’t the end of my career.’ She also admitted that her mum suffered from depression while she was growing up, and confessed that she was also unprepared for the effect menopause would have on her body.</p><p>‘All the time my emotions were torn – I should be with my kids, I should be with my parents… you know what it’s like. You have to have a house for your kids and food on the table.’ She said: ‘My poor mum when we were little, she used to lock herself in the room for a day in the dark because she was just so, so depressed. I think it can run in families as well. ‘Things happen to you… and menopause, that is a horrible thing! I remember my mum in a real state with her menopause and I just thought, ‘It can’t be that bad surely’ and yes, it can. ‘Anxiety in all sorts of things that you might never have had before. Suddenly you’re overwhelmed by things.’</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=famous-for></span>Famous For<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Being an English journalist, broadcaster, and television presenter.</li><li>For her presenting roles with the ITV Breakfast program “GMTV Today”.</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-nationality-is-fiona-phillips></span>What Nationality is Fiona Phillips?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Fiona Phillips opened her eyes for the very first on 1st January 1961 in Canterbury, Kent, England.
