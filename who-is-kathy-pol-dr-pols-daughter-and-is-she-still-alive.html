She is also now a proud mother.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Kathy Pol’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Kathylene Pol</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Kathy</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> August 21, 1973</li><li><strong>Kathy Pol’s Age:</strong> 50 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Leo</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Widowed</li><li><strong>Kathy Pol’s Late Husband:</strong> Gregor Butch</li><li><strong>Kathy Pol’s Children:</strong> Adam James Butch and Rachel Butch</li><li><strong>Kathy Pol’s Parents:</strong> Jan Pol (Dr. Pol) and Diane Pol</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Charles Pol and Diane Pol Jr.</li><li><strong>Kathy Pol’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 7 inches</li><li><strong>Kathy Pol’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 170 cm</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Dr. Pol’s daughter</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Kathy Pol and Where Was She Born?</strong></h2><p>Kathy Pol is 50 years old and was born on the 21st day of August 1973 in the United States as Kathylene Pol. However, the exact city or town in which she was born is not known. Some reports say she may have been born in Michigan but this is not certain. What is clear is that, having been born in the USA, she is an American by nationality and has caucasian ethnicity.</p><p>Kathy Pol’s star sign is Leo and over the years she has demonstrated the qualities associated with that sign. She has been described as a very creative and strong woman who has appealing leadership skills.</p><p>According to our findings, following her birth, Kathy was raised in the state of Michigan, USA. She is reported to have grown up on a farm in Michigan where she was well taught about taking care of animals and learning about crops. She is also reported to have frequently helped out her father on farm calls. She literally grew up helping out in her father’s veterinary clinic.</p><h3><strong>Kathy Has A College Degree In Phlebotomy</strong></h3><p>Kathy Pol is a well-educated woman. Not much is known about her elementary school education, however, we know that she attended the Chippewa Hills High School in Remus, Michigan, where she earned her high school diploma. Following her high school graduation, Kathy furthered her education by attending Delta College, a public community college in University Center, an unincorporated community in Michigan.</p><p>While at Delta College, Kathy majored in Phlebotomy, a field of study that focuses on the collection and extraction of blood samples for medical testing and analysis. Kathy was said to have taken an interest in medical science from early in her life and her desire to study Phlebotomy proves this.</p><h2><strong>Kathy Pol’s Father is a Renowned Veterinarian and TV Personality</strong></h2><p>Kathy Pol’s father, Jan Pol, who is widely known as “The Incredible Dr. Pol,” is one of the most fascinating people in the USA. He is a renowned veterinarian and television personality. He rose to fame as the charismatic star of Nat Geo WILD’s highly successful series, The Incredible Dr. Pol. Additionally, he is the author of the best-selling memoir titled “NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON AN ANGUS COW: My Life as a Country Vet,” which shares entertaining and heartfelt anecdotes from his impressive 45+ year veterinary career.</p><p>Born on September 4, 1942, in the Netherlands, Dr. Pol completed his veterinary studies at Utrecht University before immigrating to the United States in 1970. He then established Pol Veterinary Services, a thriving practice located in rural Michigan, where he has been providing care for a wide range of animals, both large and small, for over four decades.&nbsp; Dr. Pol’s remarkable blend of intelligence, wit, and charm has solidified his status as a pioneering figure in veterinary medicine.</p><p>Jan Pol is best known for starring in The Incredible Dr. Pol, a show which showcases the daily adventures and challenges faced by Dr. Pol and his team in their veterinary practice. Through the show, viewers embark on a journey alongside Dr. Pol as he tirelessly attends to the needs of every family pet and herd of livestock in rural Michigan. He is reported to have over 23,000 clients including everything from white mice and snakes to 2,600-pound horses and others.</p><h3><strong>Kathy Pol</strong><strong>‘s Parents Have Been Married For 56 Years</strong></h3><p>Kathy Pol’s mother is a woman called Diane Pol. She is a very intelligent woman said to be the backbone behind the success of Dr. Pol. She has played an integral role in the success of the Pol Veterinary Service. She is also a reading specialist and television personality, having made appearances on The Incredible Dr. Pol, alongside her husband. She is also the co-founder and office manager of the renowned veterinary practice.</p><p>Kathy’s parents, Diane Pol and Dr. Pol first met during their time at Mayville High School, where Dr. Pol was a foreign exchange student. Their initial encounter sparked a romance that blossomed over the years, leading to their marriage in 1967. They have remained married ever since. So far, they have been married for 56 and are still going strong.&nbsp;Also, in addition to being life partners, Diane and Jan are professional collaborators.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/07/Dr-Pol.jpg><p>Diane’s passion for education led her to teach at Harbor Beach Elementary School after earning her degree from Michigan State University. However, as Jan’s veterinary career flourished, Diane made the decision to shift her focus and actively support her husband’s work.&nbsp;In 1981, Diane and Dr. Pol joined forces to establish Pol Veterinary Service, a veterinary practice that has since gained widespread recognition and acclaim.</p><h3><strong>She Was Adopted At Birth By Her Parents</strong></h3><p>Interestingly, Kathy Pol is not the biological child of Dr. Pol and his wife, Diane Pol. She was, in fact, adopted by the couple. According to our findings, Dr. Pol and Diane did not conceive naturally when they got married, so they decided to adopt children. It is not clear why they were unable to conceive as the couple has not talked about this.</p><p>Our research confirms that Kathy was adopted at birth by the Pols on August 21, 1973. They then took her home to their farm in Michigan where they raised her. Details about who Kathy’s birth mother is, remain unknown to this day as these details have not been shared. It is also not clear if Kathy has any kind of interaction or connection with her birth mother.</p><p>Growing up on her parent’s idyllic farm in Michigan, Kathy had the interesting experience of a childhood intertwined with the wonders of nature and the responsibilities of animal care. She grew up learning about animals under the loving guidance of her father and ended up gaining hands-on experience in the field of veterinary medicine. These experiences created a profound connection between Kathy and her father.</p><p>Kathy was also very close to her mother while growing up. The Pols are known to be a very loving couple and they were said to be very doting parents. So, throughout her upbringing, Kathy was nurtured with immense love and devotion from both Dr. Pol and Diane. This has helped to shape her into the woman she now is.</p><h3><strong>All of Kathy Pol’s Siblings Were Also Adopted</strong></h3><p>Kathy Pol is not the person that was adopted by Dr. Pol and his wife, Diane Pol. As a matter of fact, Kathy has two siblings named Charles Pol and Diane Pol Jr., both of whom were adopted by their parents.</p><p>For the record, Kathy was the first child to be adopted by Dr. Pol and his wife. Then Charles and Diane Jr. followed.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Kathy Pol’s Siblings?</strong></h3><h3><strong>Charles Pol</strong></h3><p>Charles Pol is the only son of Dr. Pol and his wife Diane. He was born on March 6, 1979, in Michigan and is currently 44 years old. Charles was also adopted at birth just like Kathy. He was adopted approximately six years after Kathy’s adoption. Although details regarding his birth parents have been kept private, Charles found a loving and nurturing home with Dr. Pol and Diane.</p><p>Charles pursued his education at Chippewa Hills High School in Remus, Michigan, and then furthered his studies at the University of Miami, where he obtained a degree in communication in 2003. Following his graduation, Charles ventured to Los Angeles, where he pursued internships in the entertainment industry and gained valuable experience working with prominent Hollywood companies such as Parkway Production, Mirage Enterprises, and Paramount Pictures. He is now a Hollywood producer.</p><p>Charles Pol is now happily married to Beth Oakes, with whom he shares the joy of raising two children.</p><h3><strong>Diane Pol Jr.</strong></h3><p>Diane Pol Jr. is the last person to be adopted by Dr. Pol and his wife. However, she is older than both Kathy and Charles. Diane Jr., born on March 27, 1973, is currently 50 years old. So, although she shares the same birth year as her sister Kathy, Diane Jr. is a few months older.</p><p>Prior to being adopted by the Pols, Diane Jr. spent the first few years of her life with her birth mother named Joanna, who was a close friend of Diane, Dr. Pol’s wife. In a heartfelt tribute to her friend, Joanna named her daughter after Diane. Tragically, when Diane Jr. was around eight years old, her birth mother was diagnosed with cancer. Consequently, Diane Jr. spent a significant amount of time with the Pol family during this challenging period.</p><p>In 1982, Joanna passed away, entrusting the care of her daughter to Dr. Pol’s wife. So, at the age of nine, Diane Jr. officially became a member of the Pol family, finding a loving home and support within their embrace. However, it wasn’t until Diane Jr. turned 18 that Dr. Pol and his wife legally adopted her, solidifying their lifelong commitment.</p><p>Diane Jr. has since gone on to do well for herself. Currently, she holds the position of Director of Sales at Holiday Inn & Suites Mount Pleasant. She initially joined the company as an assistant manager and swiftly progressed to the role of manager. Her ascent to the position of Director of Sales is a testament to her hard work, dedication, and professional accomplishments.</p><h2><strong>Who Was Kathy Pol’s Husband?</strong></h2><p>Kathy Pol used to be a married woman. According to our findings, she was married to a man called Gregor Butch. While specific details about their meeting remain elusive, some reports suggest that they may have crossed paths during their college years, although this information has not been confirmed.</p><p>The duration of their courtship leading up to their marriage remains unknown. However, our findings have revealed that Kathy and Gregor exchanged their wedding vows and officially became husband and wife on July 30, 1995. Unfortunately, the finer details surrounding their wedding ceremony, such as the venue and specific arrangements, have yet to be revealed.</p><p>Kathy’s husband, Gregor Butch pursued a career as a Chemical Technologist, displaying remarkable skill and expertise in his chosen field. He was reported to have been very good at what he did and was respected. He earned well and his family was comfortable. The couple resided in Michigan where they built a loving home together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/07/Kathy-Pol.jpg><h3><strong>They Had Two Children Together</strong></h3><p>Kathy Pol and her husband, Gregor Butch, experienced the joy of parenthood as they welcomed two children into their lives. Their family expanded with the birth of their son, Adam James Butch, on August 20, 1996. A few years later, they were blessed with the arrival of their daughter, Rachel Butch.</p><p>As a mother, Kathy Pol is known for her unwavering love and devotion to her children. She prioritized their well-being and ensured they received the best upbringing possible.&nbsp;Likewise, Kathy’s husband, a dedicated father, embraced his role with love and care. Together, Kathy and her husband shared the responsibilities of parenting, providing support, guidance, and a strong foundation for their children’s growth.</p><p>Their nurturing nature and deep affection created a warm and loving environment for Adam and Rachel to thrive.</p><h2><strong>What Happened To Kathy Pol?</strong></h2><p>Sadly, Kathy Pol has endured very devastating and profound heartbreaks over the years, experiencing mind-shattering losses that have left a lasting impact on her life. The first tragedy struck when she lost her husband to cancer in 2016, followed by the second tragedy which was the untimely passing of her beloved son in 2019, under circumstances that are currently unknown.</p><p>Kathy’s married life was initially progressing really well until it reached its 17th year in 2012 when her husband Greg was diagnosed with cancer. Together, they embarked on a courageous battle against the disease, facing its challenges side by side. But, despite their unwavering efforts, Greg succumbed to the ravages of cancer on February 20, 2016, marking a devastating loss for Kathy and their family.</p><p>While she was still gradually navigating the journey of widowhood and working to find solace amidst her grief, Kathy was struck by another wave of tragedy. On September 18, 2019, her only son, Adam, passed away, leaving a void that words cannot fully express. Adam, a Michigan State University Alumnus, had a promising future ahead as a certified Pharmacy technician before he was snatched away by the cold hands of death.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding his untimely departure remain undisclosed. Apparently, the weight of these losses has undoubtedly been immense for Kathy, as she faces the unfathomable challenge of processing the grief associated with losing both her husband and her son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/07/Kathy-Pol1.jpg><h2><strong>Is Kathy Pol Still Alive?</strong></h2><p>There were rumors in recent times that Kathy Pol had died. However, contrary to these rumors, Kathy Pol is alive and thriving. The rumors of her passing began to circulate following the heartbreaking tragedies she endured, with the loss of both her son and husband. Some people felt she had also died.</p><p>However, this is not true as Kathy’s spirit perseveres, and she continues to embrace life with remarkable resilience. In fact, in a thrilling turn of events, Kathy is reported to have actually found love once again. Reports have surfaced indicating that she is currently involved in a romantic relationship with a man named Thomas Rakowski. However, the details of their relationship remain private.</p><h2><strong>What Does Dr. Pol’s Daughter Do For A Living?</strong></h2><p>Kathy Pol has followed in the footsteps of her adoptive father, Dr. Pol, by pursuing a career in the medical field. According to our research, following her graduation from Delta College with a degree in Phlebotomy, Kathy sought work in her area of specialization and actually got it.</p><p>Kathy Pol currently holds the position of Phlebotomist at McLaren Bay Region Hospital in Michigan. As a Phlebotomist, Kathy specializes in the collection of blood samples for diagnostic testing and analysis. Her work requires precision, technical expertise, and a compassionate demeanor, and she embodies these qualities. Kathy is also a well-respected person in her Michigan community, according to reports.</p><p>In addition to her work as a Phlebotomist, Kathy occasionally makes appearances in her father’s renowned reality TV series, The Incredible Dr. Pol. Apparently, the fact that she has a familial connection with the Pols has put her name on people’s lips over the years. Kathy continues to live and work in Michigan today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmajkam1unnPqKNmnKJivbC40mabmq2XncGmvoyapZ1lmah6tLTEZqqtoZyheqK4yK%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./willie-mays-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Willie Mays Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
