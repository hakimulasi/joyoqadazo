Even though his parents were born in France, Benzema is of Algerian descent. Karim grew up in a Muslim family with seven siblings. During Ramadan, he fasted, which is something he still does today. Benzema first played soccer competitively when he was eight years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Karim Benzema: Personal Life Details</h2><p>Benzema was born in Lyon, France, to parents who were French but had Algerian roots.&nbsp;His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, used to live in the village of Tigzirt, which is in the northern Algerian town of At Djellil before he moved to Lyon in the 1950s.&nbsp;Benzema’s father, Hafid, was born in Tigzirt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Karim Benzema (@karimbenzema)</a></p></figure><p>His mother, Wahida Djebbara, was born and raised in Lyon, but her family is from Oran.

In 2011, he was named the French Football Player of the Year, making him only the second French player based in Spain to do so and the second Real Madrid player to do so.</p><p>It is amazing that he has won more French Football Player of the Year awards than Zidane.

It was said that Benzema and the other French team members had been customers in a prostitution ring.</p><p>Worse yet, Benzema was accused of paying a 16-year-old girl for her services. Karim was charged with trying to get a prostitute under the age of 18 to work for him, but the charges were dropped in 2014 because there wasn’t enough evidence.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Karim Benzema (@karimbenzema)</a></p></figure><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Karim Benzema Injury: How Many Matches Will Benzema Miss?
