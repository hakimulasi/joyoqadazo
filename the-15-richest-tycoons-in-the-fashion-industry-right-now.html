And that makes sense, because people need clothes and shoes and glasses and purses and wallets. Of course we all need clothing. That's a fact of life. Even nudists have to put on pants and shirts once in a while. People who go into the fashion business aren't doing it for the glamour of seeing their creations sashay down a runway. They do it to sell clothing. From LVMH's Bernard Arnault to Zara's Amancio Ortega to H&M's <a href=# title="Stefan Persson Net Worth">Stefan Persson</a> to the American icon <a href=# title="Ralph Lauren Net Worth">Ralph Lauren</a>, these 15 people are the richest fashion industry tycoons in the world and they make everything from haute couture to $5 T-shirts.</p><p>The combined top 15-richest fashion industry tycoons are worth roughly a combined $361.4 billion.</p><p>Noticeably missing from this year's list is Forever 21 founders Do Won and Jin Sook Chang.

It wasn't long before he started designing a line of wide neckties made from rags. He sold these ties to mom and pop stores, one by one across New York City. Then, one day, Neiman Marcus called and ordered 100 dozen. An empire was born. Lauren branched out into sportswear in the 1970s, introducing the ubiquitous Polo shirt. By the 1980s, Lauren, alongside American designers <a href=# title="Donna Karan Net Worth">Donna Karan</a> and <a href=# title="Calvin Klein Net Worth">Calvin Klein</a>, had come to symbolize aspirational country club preppy style. Ralph Lauren now puts out not just a men's and women's clothing line, but through its licensing arm, also cosmetics, fragrances, leather goods, footwear, eyeglasses, and home goods.

The high fashion brand was founded back in 1909, by their grandfather Pierre Wertheimer and his partner Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel, the company's namesake. Eventually, the family bought out <a href=# title="Coco Chanel Net Worth">Coco Chanel's</a> remaining stake in the House of Chanel after she passed away in the 1970s. Alain and Gerard took over operations of the luxury brand after their father died in 1986. Apart from clothing, Chanel sells perfume, makeup, jewelry, watches and other fashion accessories.

Stefan Persson: $25 billion</strong></p><p>Stefan Persson's father Erling Persson founded the women's clothing store Hennes in 1947. He was inspired by stores like Macy's and Barney's during a trip to the U.S. and wanted to bring a store like that to Sweden. In 1968, he acquired Mauritz Widforss, a hunting store that also carried a men's clothing line. This led to the creation of H&M (Hennes & Mauritz), which today is the world's biggest purveyor of fast fashion. In 1982, H&M expanded to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Moscow and New York.&nbsp;Today H&M is worldwide.</p><p><strong>#4.
