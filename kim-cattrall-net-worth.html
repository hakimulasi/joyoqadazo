That amount was one-third of the $1 million that Sarah Jessica Parker was paid per episode at the time.</p><p>For the first Sex and the City movie, Kim was paid $7 million, while Sarah was paid $13 million. Kim earned $10 million for the second film. These financial discrepancies caused quite a bit of stress between the cast members. Kim and Sara Jessica Parker famously had a massive falling-out at some point after second film. Their relationship was so bad that Kim was not invited to appear in 2021's 10-episode revival series "And Just Like That…". While her former cast members each earned $1 million per episode of the revival, Kim was not involved at all and was in fact written off as having died.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Kim Cattrall has been married three times and has no children.

Cattrall briefly dated former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.</p><p>The enthusiastic Liverpool F.C. fan splits her time between New York City and the East Hamptons. She holds British and Canadian citizenship, and in August 2020 became an American citizen.</p><p>On December 21, 1988, Cattrall was booked on Pan AM flight 103 from London to New York. She missed her flight because she made a last minute decision to go shopping at the department store Harrods to get a teapot for her mother. She re-booked herself on a flight that departed Heathrow airport 45 minutes after Pan AM 103 departed. When she landed in New York, she learned that her original flight had been brought down by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board.</p><p>In February 2018, Cattrall tweeted the public asking for help. Her brother Christopher had gone missing in Alberta, Canada. He was sadly found dead several hours later, having committed suicide.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1998 Kim paid $420,000 for a waterfront home in East Hampton, New York.
