The Bakgatla people gained their tribal name from Cheif Mokgatla, reports <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kruger Park</a></i>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoy reading our stories? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Download</a> the BRIEFLY NEWS app on Google Play now and stay up-to-date with major South African news!</strong></p><p class=align-left>Several tribes made up the Pedi people who were quite wealthy under the rule of King Thulare who ruled the Pedi Empire in 1800. After his death in 1824, two years of disputes followed as fights over who would be his successor ensued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/ee43945e3425c4a4.jpg><p class=align-left>King Thulare's son, Sekwati, took over and stabilised the political entity. He was succeeded by his son Sekhukhune 1 who refused to pay any tax to <a href=#>Government</a>. This resulted in the First Sekhukhune War that lasted months.</p><p class=align-left>King Sekhukhune 1 was victorious in his battle but was attacked again by the British causing the Second Sekhukune War, reports <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Buzz SA</a></i>. The King was arrested in 1879 and released in 1881 where he was murdered by his stepbrother.</p><h2>The religion and traditional practices of South Africa's Pedi people</h2><p class=align-left>The publication reported that a large number of Pedi people follow Christianity but there are still members who are heavily involved in their traditional practices.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/75c46ed9a8970173.jpg><p class=align-left>Although modern influences and technology can be expected to change certain things, the Pedi people who are strong in their traditions and have not changed much about themselves.</p><p class=align-left>The Pedi people practice what is known as 'ancestral worship'. They participate in acts such as animal sacrifice and the offering of beer, reports <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SA History</a></i>.</p><h2>The culture and clothing of South Africa's Pedi people</h2><p class=align-left>Pedi people's creativity in their beadwork, colours and patterns are stunning. Pedi men wear clothes that are similar to kilts and adorn themselves in beads on their necks and arms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8c8c53fabeefe45e.jpg><p class=align-left>Pedi women tend to wear large dresses or calf-length skirts paired with pleated tops. Women used to wear aprons which were known as 'ntepa' and 'lebole'. They also adorn themselves with beads and some tend to wear headscarves.</p><h2>The food eaten by South Africa's Pedi people</h2><p class=align-left>Although colonisation has played a massive part in changing the dietary habits of the Pedi people, many still maintain their cultural heritage. Like many Saffa cultures, Pedi food consists of vegetables, meat and traditional beer.</p><h2>The language spoken by the Pedi people of South Africa</h2><p class=align-left>Pedi people speak Sepedi. Confusion tends to set in as many believe that Pedi people are speaking Northern Sotho. These are two different groups of people who speak two different languages. Sepedi is more closely related to Tswana and is spoken in <a href=#>Limpopo</a>, parts of Gauteng and the North West Province.</p><h2>The lives led by the Pedi people of South Africa today</h2><p class=align-left>Pedi people are still strong in their traditions and culture and display their lives on social media - as do many others. Modernised versions of traditional attire and westernised food make up their lives today.</p><p class=align-left><i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Britannica</a></i> reports that the traditional territory of the Pedi people is between the Olifants and Steelpoort rivers in Limpopo.</p><h2>"Put My Sotho Swag on": Lady has SA going gaga after sharing wedding snaps</h2><p class=align-left>In other news about SA cultures, <strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that a local woman had SA gushing after <a href=#>sharing some absolutely flawless pictures of herself</a> from a recent traditional wedding.</p><p class=align-left>While the guest had absolutely no intention of stealing the show, she shut it down in a red number that clearly had everyone talking.
