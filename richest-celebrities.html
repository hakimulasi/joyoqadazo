They married on Valentine's Day of that year, and they announced their split in May 2017, a few weeks after Andrew was arrested for allegedly grabbing Elle by the throat, throwing her on a bed, and threatening to kill her. TMZ reported that King later said that "things just got out of hand while they were partying" and declined to press charges. In a 2018 interview with "People" magazine, Elle said that after the marriage ended, "I was partying so hard to numb emotions that I couldn't handle at the time. I realized it was just prolonging the inevitable of dealing with them… I thought that by doing drugs it would buy me time to feeling better. And when that wasn't working, I just realized I was in this other cycle, and that I was creating it myself. And I realized I needed to cut all the darkness out of my life."</p><p>In March 2021, King revealed that after two miscarriages due to polycystic ovary syndrome, she was expecting a baby with tattoo artist Dan Tooker, who she had been engaged to since October 2020. The couple welcomed son Lucky Levi Tooker on September 1, 2021, and Elle's mother served as the "best doula ever" during her pregnancy. A few weeks after Lucky's birth, King wrote on Instagram, "Lucky is incredible and oh so cute. I am in love. I always wanted to be a mom, but I never imagined it would be this good."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>King has been nominated for four Grammys: Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance for "Ex's & Oh's" (2016) and Best Country Duo/Group Performance for "Different For Girls" (2017) and "Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)" (2022).
