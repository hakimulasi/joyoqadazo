Moreover, David has the striking net worth of&nbsp;20 million accumulated from his real estate business.</p><p>Talking about his ex-wife, Shannon, she is a television reality star, who has the same amount of net worth of as David at $20 million.</p><h3><strong>David Beador's Extra-Marital Affair And Divorced From Wife After 17 Years Of Marriage</strong></h3><p>David's ups and downs in his personal front were depicted in the television reality series,&nbsp;Real Housewives of Orange County. He was married to reality television personality Shannon Beador in September 2000.&nbsp;The couple is the parents of three daughters; 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins, Stella and Adeline. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After 16 years of marriage David was involved in an extramarital affair with a friend of Shannon, which ultimately led to their divorce.</p><p>He was having an affair with the&nbsp;43-year-old entrepreneur Nicole McMackin, a friend of Shannon. Nichole, the&nbsp;President of IT solutions and personnel firm, Irvine Technology Corporation&nbsp;met David&nbsp;at a meeting of an elite business club for entrepreneurs, Young President’s Organization at California in September 2013. And after the meeting, the couple continued to stay in touch with each other and started meeting in hotels outside the county, to keep their affair a secret.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Shannon started to take David's frequent outings suspiciously and&nbsp;before filming had started for Season 10 of the RHOC, she checked David’s briefcase while he was out and found the hotel receipts padded inside. She confronted David after he returned home, and demanded answers from him, which led to David's admission about their affair.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>David and Shannon&nbsp;ended their marriage through the divorce in October 2017, and Shanon issued a statement about their divorce saying:</p><p>After much thought and careful consideration, David and I have made the difficult decision to separate.

From the family support amount, a total of $12,000 goes to David's children while remaining $10,500 falls under Shannon's separate expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The courtroom discussion ended up in arguments that later followed public bicker. Radar witnessed Shannon's disgust for David as she left the place full on rage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>You are such a nickel and dimer! It's disgusting!</p><p>Because Shannon earns herself a sum of more than $300,000 annually, the former husband is willing to cut the family support laid on his part. But turns out the former wife has it in her might to take what she thinks she deserves. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite having a heated divorce settlement raging on, Davis has a lady love to provide him with a break from the courtroom hassles.
