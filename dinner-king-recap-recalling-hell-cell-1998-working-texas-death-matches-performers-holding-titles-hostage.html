He received a very nice private message from the verified account of retired NBA player, Spud Webb. Lawler was surprised and thought it was very cool so replied with an equally nice message for Webb. All of a sudden the conversation took &nbsp;a strange turn as Webb asked Lawler for his number, saying he’d love to hook up with Lawler and his girlfriend, Lauren at some point.<br>Lawler became suspicious and ignored the account, but then the account followed his girlfriend, Lauren, who gave them Lawler’s home phone number. For a while he ignored calls from this person as Moore tried to tell Lawler that this was definitely a fake account. Sure enough, the account turned out to be fake and it has since been reported and taken down.<br><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ringsidenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jerry-Lawler-2018-NEW-300x188.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Lawler speaks about the iconic Hell In A Cell match from King of the Ring 1998 featuring The Undertaker and Mankind. It’s been 20 years since that night, and the events are still fresh in Lawler’s mind. He points out that he and Jim Ross had no idea that Foley was going to take those extreme bumps that night, and he thinks their call for this match was so passionate because it was their legitimate reactions to what they were seeing.<br>He points out that when Foley broke through the top of the cell and landed on the top of his neck and his head, he thought for sure that we had witnessed the end of Foley. He recalls referee Tim White talking about the match, informing that Undertaker even asked him to check if Foley was breathing at one point. They thought for sure Foley was dead, and Lawler calls Foley “Superman” for surviving that match.<br><br>Lawler speaks about the famous Concession Stand Brawl match from Tupelo, Mississippi back in 1979. This was a true hardcore match which was a rarity in those days, so it was something nobody had ever seen before. It has gone down in Memphis Wrestling lore, and is held in similarly high regard to the Empty Arena Match between Lawler and Terry Funk.<br>Lawler points out that the promoters in Tupelo were an old Southern couple and the wife definitely wore the pants in the relationship. She was furious when she heard and saw what was happening in the concessions because she thought it was a legitimate fight at first. Lawler says the husband was okay with it, as long as they didn’t break his prized popcorn machine.<br><br>Lawler informs that he’s been involved in a number of unique matches throughout the course of his career. He was a part of Scaffold matches but he was never a fan of those. He recalls Jim Cornette falling from a scaffold during one match which resulted in him breaking multiple bones.<br>He also worked some barbed wire matches and he didn’t really have a problem with those, he’d just make sure that someone else was being cut with the barbed wire instead of him. He notes that they didn’t gimmick the barbed wire back then; it was legitimate barbed wire.<br><br>Lawler worked a Texas Death match as well, where falls counted anywhere and the match continued until one competitor or team simply couldn’t continue. He recalls one specific match going 26 or 27 falls before the match ended. He says he particularly loved working with Dutch Mantel back then because Mantel provided quick-witted interviews and was a very entertaining performer. He adds that there was always a healthy competition between both of them, probably because they were both born on the exact same day.<br>Lawler mentions that during his time running Memphis Wrestling there were a couple of instances where a certain performer would win a Title and then refuse to show up until they were paid more money. This would really anger Lawler.<br><br>He mentions that Jeff Jarrett famously did that to Vince McMahon with the Intercontinental Title during the attitude era. McMahon paid Jarrett the extra money, Jarrett dropped the belt and went to WCW, and then when McMahon bought WCW Jarrett was quickly fired. That’s why it surprised some to see Jarrett inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame last year.<br>That sums up this week’s episode of Dinner With the King.
