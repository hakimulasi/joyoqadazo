Selected as the fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft by the Kings, Murray’s journey from his roots in Iowa to the grand stage of the NBA is nothing short of remarkable.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 id=h-early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Murray’s basketball journey began at Prairie High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he first showcased his exceptional talent.

This remarkable performance was the first 20-point, 20-rebound game by an Iowa player since 1977. Such moments of brilliance became a hallmark of his college career.</p><p>However, adversity struck on November 29 when Murray suffered an ankle injury during a game against Virginia forcing him to miss a crucial matchup. Nevertheless, he rebounded strongly, exemplified by a stellar performance on December 18 when he scored 35 points in a resounding 94–75 victory over Utah State. His career-high 37 points on February 13, 2022, in a 98–75 win against Nebraska showcased his scoring prowess.</p><p>On March 29, 2022, Murray made the momentous decision to declare for the 2022 NBA draft forgoing his remaining college eligibility and embarking on the next chapter of his basketball journey.</p><h2><strong>Sacramento Kings</strong></h2><p>The 2022 NBA draft held the promise of Murray’s transition to the professional ranks and it was the Sacramento Kings who saw his potential.
