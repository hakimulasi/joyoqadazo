Tom has sometimes made appearances in his games with Maki, his wife.</p><p>Tom is paddling, and Maki has joined him on a bodyboard. The masses made it challenging to locate sound waves.</p><p>The couple is blessed with two sons, Francis and Patrick.</p><p>The pair seemed to be very much in love with one another. Since Tom and Marie first divorced, Maki has supported him through everything.</p><h2><span id=Marie_Curren_is_where_Tom_Curren8217s_former_spouse>Marie Curren is where?

A year later, the two of them traveled to Santa Barbara, California.</p><p>Pat became a professional surfer, dived for abalone, and created bikinis for Jeanine’s store while Jeanine ran a bikini boutique.</p><p>Tom Curren, their first child, was in the water almost from the moment he could walk, having been born in 1964. Tom is the elder brother of Joe and Anna Curren.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>American surfer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Dr James Masterson Cause And Death: What Happened</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Danny Fullbrook Wikipedia | BBC Journalist Age Parents And Family</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfqbyuecKuqaudnmLEqrLEZqSao5lisLa%2B0Z6lZq%2BYmr%2BmecisZKGho2KyuXnMmqminV2YwrO%2BxKdm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tutankhamun-allies-enemies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tutankhamun: Allies &amp;amp; Enemies | PBS">&larr;
