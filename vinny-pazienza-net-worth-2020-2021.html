Vinny was born in a family of three, and he is the lastborn and has two elder sisters.</p><p>Vinny’s parents loved him a lot, and they wanted to see him progress and become the best in school. However, Vinny’s interests were very different, as his passion was in sports, and he was physically ready for the same task. Learning was not anywhere in his list of the things that he was to take seriously. To him, athletics was the most important thing that he had in his mind. His physical fitness was, however, an added advantage as he was able to take care of his sisters when he was in high school.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Vinny is among celebrities who have chosen to keep their private life away from the public. Although he was a celebrity who had many fans, he never revealed any personal information to the public, and he decided to let them know just what was necessary.

Most of his wins were with a knockout, and he, therefore, attracted a lot of fans not only in his locality but also around the USA. Many people looked forward to watching his matches.</p><p>After winning so many competitions at the start of his career, he was given the golden opportunity of fighting for the title in 1987. In Providence, Rhode Island, Vinny challenged Greg Huyen for the world lightweight champion title.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Listing down all the trophies and wins Vinny has received during the years of his career, would be almost impossible.
