The executive vice president of alternative programming at Universal Media Studios and NBC explained the choice at the time.</p><p class=Fg>Paul Telegdy said they couldn't have a panel with the hottest American music without having an impactful country music presence. He explained that Shelton was at the top of his game then.</p><p class=Fg>Telegdy <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/blake-shelton-joins-nbcs-voice-164991/>shared</a> how the musician wasn't only "charismatic" but had a passion for "collaborating with and bringing the best out of other talented artists." The then-executive vice president <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/blake-shelton-joins-nbcs-voice-164991/>said</a> that made Shelton the "perfect choice" to round off the coaches.</p><p class=Fg>However, by October 2022, it appeared "The Voice" had reached the end of an era when the show's network announced some changes for its 23rd season. NBC revealed that Niall Horan and Chance the Rapper would be new coaches on the show.</p><p class=Fg>Shelton and Kelly Clarkson were supposed to return as coaches, with Carson Daly remaining the host.

The star put his fans' minds at ease when he elaborated on why he was retiring from "The Voice."</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Why Is Blake Retiring from "The Voice"?</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>In February 2022, Shelton confessed he didn't know what he was signing up for when he married Gwen Stefani and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-talks-family-life-with-gwen-stefani/>took on the role of stepfather</a> to her three sons. However, he was ready for it, and each day he fell in love with the boys as much as he did with his wife.</p><p class=Fg>The television personality started knowing Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo in 2015 when he began dating their mother. He and Stefani married in 2021 after her marriage to her children's father, Gavin Rossdale, failed.</p><p class=Fg>Shelton <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-talks-family-life-with-gwen-stefani/>said</a> he'd not only married the pop singer but had done so "into a family."

I love all the cool things I get to do with my job, but those things all take a backseat now to Gwen and the kids, and itâ€™s just a new phase of my life."</p><p class=Fg>When asked how he felt about taking on the role of being a stepfather, Shelton said he took it seriously. However, he wasn't so uptight about it that he didn't enjoy it as they were five years into the relationship at the time, with him <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.audacy.com/kfrog/latest/blake-shelton-loves-that-hes-going-to-be-a-stepdad>adding</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I can't imagine my life without these kids now."</p><p class=Fg>When he uploaded a mysterious post referencing the upcoming holidays, Stefani's husband's fans were left with more questions than answers. Some people wanted to know what was happening, while others guessed he was working on new music.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Why Do Fans Have a Lot of Questions after Blake's Recent Post?</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>On November 2, 2022, Shelton shared a post of a chair in a mini studio placed before Christmas decorations and noted how it was that time of the year as he got in the festive spirit.

Stefani said her mother liked doing turkey in her way, while Shelton experimented with several smaller ones.</p><p class=Fg>The country star and his stepsons made a Cheetos turkey once, and that year they did a bacon-wrapped one. Stefani said that year they did mac and cheese, but it hadn't been an addition before, and something new was included each year.</p><p class=Fg>The pop singer felt it was stressful, but she wanted her children to have great memories and knew she and her husband could pull that off.
