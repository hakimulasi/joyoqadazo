Got my second nipple pierced 12 months ago. Anyway, I had wanted the PA for the longest time so I got one 3 years ago at age 25. Loved the way it looked and my fav porn star is Jesse Santana who has one. Then two years ago a friend of mine who also had a PA and both nipples went out and got a guiche. He showed me and straight away I went out and got one. It looked amazing and I knew i wanted one. I’ve since convinced another friend of mine to get a guiche too and next month will get his nipples done. Also convinced another friend to get his nipples pierced and this weekend will get his dick pierced. He’s 23 and a mega babe.</p><p>The guiche is my fav piercing.
