Kevin’s life, though tragically cut short at the age of 66, was a testament to the power of love, family, and friendship. Born on February 23, 1957, in Plymouth, Wisconsin, Kevin was the son of David and Dolores Barry. His journey through life would be marked by hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to those he held dear. Kevin’s professional career spanned an impressive 30 years at the Jeep Corporation, beginning in 1976. He was known as a diligent and dedicated worker, earning the respect and admiration of his colleagues over the years.</p><p>However, it was his personal life that truly defined Kevin. In 1976, he married the love of his life, Debra Lynn Reed, affectionately known as “Boo Boo.” Their union lasted an incredible 47 years, a testament to their enduring love and partnership. Kevin was a man with a heart of gold, always willing to lend a helping hand to family and friends with their projects. He had a passion for the simple joys in life – whether it was going fishing with his beloved grandbabies, tinkering with tractors, embarking on hunting adventures with his sons, enjoying casino trips with his daughters, or heading up North with loved ones for unforgettable getaways.</p><p>His love for family and friends extended to game nights with his siblings and late-night gossip sessions with his best friend, Tom. Kevin’s ability to connect with people and bring joy to their lives was one of his most cherished qualities. He is survived by his loving wife, Debra, their two sons, Todd and Justin, and his cherished grandchildren – Wyatt, Morgan, and Casey. Kevin’s family was not limited to blood relations; he had a special place in the hearts of his sisters, Vicki Jancsi, Mary Schreck, Kelley Stram, and brother, Kristopher Barry. He was also cherished by his sisters-in-law, Denise Reed, Diane Dotson, brother-in-law Danny Reed, and his best friend, Tom Kasper. Even Willow, the beloved family fur baby, felt the warmth of Kevin’s love.</p><p>Kevin’s life was enriched by his many nieces, nephews, and friends who were like family to him. He was preceded in death by his parents, a brother, David Michael Barry Jr., and a sister, Liana Schreck, who we can imagine welcomed him with open arms on the other side. To pay respects to Kevin Barry Sr., a visitation will be held from 2:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, October 10, 2023, at Urbanski’s Bedford Funeral Chapel, 8300 Lewis Ave., Temperance, MI. The funeral service will be held at 7:30 p.m., followed by cremation. The family extends a heartfelt thank-you to Kevin’s niece, Jodi, for her support during this difficult time. In lieu of flowers, they kindly request that you donate blood, a gesture that embodies Kevin’s spirit of giving and saving lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZLimwsinZJuZoqfGbrvBoquumaKueq27zaCroqWVYr%2Bmv8idnKesXZbBbsDEpqeeqpGjsKZ5zKJkoZmjYr2iv9Kem2aZp5bGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1425789-montana-helena-klein-yaos-biography-age-ethnicity-husband-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Montana Helena Klein Yao's biography: age, ethnicity, husband">&larr;
