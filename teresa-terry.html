Teresa was born in South Carolina, United States, and holds American citizenship. In addition, she is a Catholic. She went unnoticed and was not well known until her marriage to Todd Chrisley.

Then, Teresa joined one of the best universities in America to further her education. However, Teresa did not reveal the name of her school and university.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=teresa-terry-s-career><span id=Career><strong>Career</strong></span></h3><p>Many people have asked about Teresa Terry’s career. However, the main thing about Teresa Terry is that she is&nbsp; Todd Chrisley’s ex-wife. Although Teresa Terry’s ex-husband Todd is a television personality best known for hosting trendy TV shows like “Chrisley Knows Best” and “Theo Chrisley,” little or nothing is known about Teresa’s career.</p><p>It seems her ex-husband’s popularity and popularity have eclipsed it. She is never open to discussing her professional life or career. Teresa may have something for her to do about a job or something that interests her, but her lack of seriousness makes it more difficult to find information about her.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=relationship-status><span id=Relationship_Status><strong>Relationship Status</strong></span></h3><p>Teresa Terry Chrisley is married to Todd Chrisley. They met at their high school in Westminster, South Carolina. After they met, she developed feelings for Todd and thus began dating. Plus, Todd was only two years older than her.

After 15 months of giving birth to their first child, the couple again had another child named Kyle Chrisley.</p><p>Sadly, Teresa and Todd’s married life could not be successful. After a few years of living together, they divorced. Todd abused Teresa physically and mentally. After Todd tried to kill Teresa with a knife, she considered ending the marriage.</p><p>They completed their divorce proceedings in 1996 and began to share custody of their children. She then filed for sole custody and won in 2002. Also, she remarried after a few years of divorce and had two children with him. But the name and other details of her current husband are not known.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=measurements-and-social-network-instagram-twitter-and><span id=Measurements_and_Social_Networks_Instagram_Twitter_and_Facebook><strong>Measurements and Social Networks:&nbsp; Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook</strong></span></h3><p>Regarding her physical stats, Teresa Terry is 5’4″ (1.63m) tall and weighs about 130lb (59kg). Likewise, Teresa has a shoe size of 6.5 inches. Also, she has blonde hair with beautiful black eyes.

She must be enjoying her peaceful life away from social media.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=net-worth><span id=Net_worth><strong>Net worth</strong></span></h3><p>With little or no information on Terry’s occupation, it’s hard to say this woman’s net worth. But without a doubt, the divorce helped her amass some net wealth. According to the source, Teresa’s net worth is $150,000.</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp; her ex-husband earns a lot of money. His net worth is $46 million.
